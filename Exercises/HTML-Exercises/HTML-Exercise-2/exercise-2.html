    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Alan Turing, born on June 23, 1912, in London, England, is celebrated as one of the most brilliant minds in computer science and mathematics. His groundbreaking work during World War II at Bletchley Park, where he played a pivotal role in breaking the German Enigma code, significantly aided Allied efforts and shortened the war. Turing's contributions extended beyond wartime cryptography; he formalized concepts of computation and algorithms with his concept of the Turing machine, often regarded as the foundation of modern computing. Despite his profound impact on technology, Turing tragically faced persecution for his homosexuality, which led to his death in 1954. His legacy endures as a pioneer whose ideas laid the groundwork for the digital age and artificial intelligence.</p>
    <h2>Major Accomplishments</h2>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li>
            <strong>Cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park:</strong> Turing played a pivotal role in breaking the Enigma code used by Nazi Germany during World War II, a feat that significantly shortened the war and saved countless lives by providing Allied forces with crucial intelligence.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Conceptualization of the Turing Machine:</strong> Turing introduced the concept of the Turing machine in 1936, a theoretical model that laid the foundation for modern computing and helped establish the principles of algorithmic computation and the limits of mechanical computation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Turing Test for Artificial Intelligence:</strong> He proposed the Turing Test in 1950 as a benchmark for determining a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human, which continues to influence research in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
